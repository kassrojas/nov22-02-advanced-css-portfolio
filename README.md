## Description
The goal of this portfolio project is to introduce myself and my deployed applications using my current knowledge of HTML and further experience with CSS. The webpage features functionality of links that navigate the user within the application as well as outside of it. Accessibility feature standards were maintained to ensure users are able to easily navigate the page. More advanced CSS code such as flex-box helped to tie the entire webpage together. This portfolio provides users with references to past work and several ways in which to contact me.
